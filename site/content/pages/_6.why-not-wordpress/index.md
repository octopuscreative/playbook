      #  Security
      
      Every CMS and framework suffers the occasional security flaw. However, WordPress has a “richer” [history of security bugs](http://scobleizer.com/2009/09/05/i-dont-feel-safe-with-wordpress-hackers-broke-in-and-took-things/) and choices in the system that lead to vulnerabilities, including various [exploits](http://www.readwriteweb.com/biz/2011/01/the-hidden-dangers-of-free-wor.php) and [vulnerabilities](http://markmaunder.com/2011/08/01/zero-day-vulnerability-in-many-wordpress-themes/) in downloadable themes and plugins. For a comprehensive list of WordPress exploits, [check this out](http://www.wordpressexploit.com/).
      
      Part of this stems from the model. WordPress makes it super easy to install themes and plugins through the administrative interface. Which means being able to drop in executable code via the admin interface.
      
      There are quite a few major WordPress sites running out there without a single security glitch. And no framework or CMS is wholly free of security flaws. But we’re more comfortable building for our clients using a framework with security baked into the design.
