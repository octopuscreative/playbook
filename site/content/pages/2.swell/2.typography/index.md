            Font sizes are based off of the modular scale. The scale is made up of two main variables: `$rem-base` and `$ratio`. Your `$rem-base` should be a pixel value equivalent to your main body font size. The default is 16px. Your `$ratio` determines how your font sizes will scale. A higher ratio will create larger differences between levels, while a smaller ratio will create smaller differences between levels.
            
            Using a scale helps to establish a hierarchy within the design and prevents us – the developers – from writing arbitrary values for font sizes of elements.
