      SEO is perhaps one of the most mis-understood area for clients. For years blogs have been writing articles with SEO "advice" where they'll advertise tips or tricks to magically get your site to the first page in a Google search. In fact, search engines such as Google will actually penalize sites that employ sneaky tactics to boost their ranking. The reality is that there is no shortcut to higher rankings, and people often spend time focussing on everything but what actually matters - their content and their connections. Search engines look for quality, easy to read content along with well structured HTML.

      ## Is "improved SEO" something that we can accommodate/offer to clients?
      
      Mostly, yes. There's not any one quick thing that we can do to instantly improve their SEO and PageRank, but there are a number of smaller things that we can do to make sure best practices and standards are followed. This includes a markup audit where we look through their site's markup and add any missing tags like titles to links, alts to images, make sure they have the proper meta tags defined in the head, as well as rework some of their content follow Google's best practies.  Aside from that, we can set them up with a Google Webmaster account where they can submit sitemaps, view any SEO mistakes they might be making, tell Google to index certain pages, and even view their site as Google sees it. Beyond that they just need to get more people to link to their site.
