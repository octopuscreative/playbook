      ## "Baseline" requirements for a usable store
      
      We say baseline here because they're certainly not needed for a store to work well, but certainly almost every client will ask for these features:
      
       * Quick quantity adjustments from the cart drawer/popover & the ability to quick remove products from the cart
       * Cart page with a list of products, and the ability to update quantities / remove products from the cart. Should also include the ability to add coupons
       * Out of stock messaging for product cards/display pages for producsts that are out of stock
       * Sale messaging for product cards/display pages for products that are on sale
       * Empty cart messaging
