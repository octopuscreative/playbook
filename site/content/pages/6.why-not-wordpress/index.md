      # Content Managment
      
      A lot of people point out that there are _tons_ of plugins out there for WordPress, so much in fact that you can do anything with it. The reality is though that out of the box, WordPress comes with a very limited set of capabilities and the vast majority of what a client needs from us wouldn't be possible without using plugins. This is an issue because when you start to use plugins, you then depened on whoever is maintaining said plugins for sercurity updates, bugfixes, or even just good documentation. There's also the classic problem of "Installing plugin B breaks plugin A that I installed yesterday". Good luck fixing that!

      Every CMS and framework suffers the occasional security flaw. However, WordPress has a “richer” [history of security bugs](http://scobleizer.com/2009/09/05/i-dont-feel-safe-with-wordpress-hackers-broke-in-and-took-things/) and choices in the system that lead to vulnerabilities, including various [exploits](http://www.readwriteweb.com/biz/2011/01/the-hidden-dangers-of-free-wor.php) and [vulnerabilities](http://markmaunder.com/2011/08/01/zero-day-vulnerability-in-many-wordpress-themes/) in downloadable themes and plugins.
