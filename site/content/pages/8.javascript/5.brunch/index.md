      [Brunch](http://brunch.io/) is an opinionated build tool that values convention over configuration. We like this because it saves us time in the project setup phase and becasue once the team understands the conventions, switching between projects comes with less cognitive overhead. Besides all that, brunch is _really_ fast.
