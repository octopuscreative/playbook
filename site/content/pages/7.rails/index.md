      ## Why Rails?
      
      ## Common Problems
      ### XSRF Token Missing 
      Requests to an API generally will not include the rails XSRF token in the header and so they will fail with a `401` 
      ## Recomended Tooling
      ### Authentication
      *Devise* - Platformatic
      
      Provides a battle tested auth DSL that covers all of the most common use cases and includes helpers, views and controllers to get things up and running fast.
      
      ### Authorization
      *Pundit* - ELABS
      
      By far the best authorization gem out there.
