      > Do we actually need any dynamic content features?
      
      Most likely, yes. If you plan on editing the content of your site in any way you will need dynamic content features. It saves you money because you don't have to pay us to do it and it saves us the project setup/teardown time
      
      > How will we host this site? How will we deploy it? How will we roll it back?
      
      This is another great thing about Statamic. It will run pretty much anywhere you have PHP and Apache or Nginx. This is a very common hosting environment. We recommed services like [A Small Orange](https://asmallorange.com/) if you just need something small and managed, or [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) if you want more control of your environment while keeping the bill down
