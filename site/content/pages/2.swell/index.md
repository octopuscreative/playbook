      Swell is a barebones utility CSS framework that is agnostic of design, allowing you – the developer – to build websites and application interfaces efficiently from project to project.
      
      ## Why utility classes?
      
      "But that's how we've always done it." Even between us at Octopus, we were hesistant to adopt something so different from how websites and apps have been styles since the beginning of CSS; but, after one too many projects with CSS inhertiance issues and overwriting styles throughout a deep nesting of SASS files, we decided to give it a go.
      
      Like getting on a bike for the first time, it felt weird to see so much going on in the markup; but, we realized two  things:
      
      1. Views and functionality were being built incredibly quickly.
      2. We could do much more than we thought with simple styles.
      3. We could see exactly what styles were being applied to all the elements without having to dig through inspector.
      
      This is an example of an inline code block: `.ta-center`. Followed by an example of a full code block.
      
      ```
      .ta-center
      ```
