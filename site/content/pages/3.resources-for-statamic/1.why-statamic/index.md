      ## Flexability
      
      For starters, Statamic is incredibly flexible. Where other CMS's might make assumptions about the type of content you'll be working with, Statamic does not. This means that from the start we can hit the ground running without having to trudge through pre-written code for a content type we don't even want. With Statamic 2 there's now an included field type editor. This means that while the site is being designed we devs can be busy scaffoling out the backend. Opps, need a section renamed? No problem, easy fix. Need a whole new collection that was never discussed before? Again, no problem at all. Because our CMS is flexible, it means that we too can be flexible and produce for the client exactly what they need.
      
      ## Extensibility
      
      Statamic is built on top of Laravel, a cutting edge modern web app framework. If there's something we need to do that Statamic can't do out of the box, Laravel can handle it. Even better yet Statamic [provides tools](https://docs.statamic.com/addons/getting-started) for us devs that make creating and sharing addons too easy. We're not a PHP shop, but we've been able to some pretty cool things with minimal effort because of the docs and tools provided to us by Statamic/Laravel.
      
      ## Documentation
      
      Seriously, the [Statamic Docs](https://docs.statamic.com/reference) are really good. What does that mean for our clients? It means that they get a well built and maintainable site faster.
      
      ## Speed
      
      ## Truly Customized Content Editing
      
      ## Searching & Forms Baked In
      
      ## Support
      
      The Statamic community has a very vibrant support community. There hasn't been anything we've needed to but couldn't because there's always someone in their Slack to lend a hand.
