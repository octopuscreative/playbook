      A quick solution to problems that the asset pipeline introduces, like JavaScript load order and excessive globals, is to use the [browserify-rails](https://github.com/browserify-rails/browserify-rails) gem. This gem doesn't replace the asset pipeline, but rather it builds upon it. With a couple of simple config udates you'll have the power of browserify and all of its transforms at your fingertips.
